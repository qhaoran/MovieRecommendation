# MovieRecommendation
Building recommendation system using data mining techniques

Recommendation system is extremely pervasive in almost everywhere. This project exploits Spark and also SparkML lib to process movie rating data from MovieLens.com (dataset could be found here: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). It's currently an ongoing project. I've completed calculation of avgrage rating for each movie and frequent item set generation so far.
